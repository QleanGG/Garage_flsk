# Garage with Flask
<p>In this project, I used an old template I had for a client side Garage and added a back end server using flask.<br>
You are able to see the whole database through a table in the main page and intaract with it through that page!</p>

## Usage
In order to open the server you will need to have requirements.txt to install you with the relevant packages

After that please open app.py and you are all set!

## Features 
- Add a car to the database
